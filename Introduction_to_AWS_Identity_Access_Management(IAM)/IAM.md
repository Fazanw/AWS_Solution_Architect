# Introduction Identity Access Management
##
This lab will cover the basics of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), which is a web service that helps the user securely control access to AWS resources. The motive of this lab is to walk the user through creating IAM users and adding them to IAM groups, along with permission policies, to provide access to various services in the AWS account.
