# Build Amazon VPC with Public and Private Subnets (from Scratch)
##
This lab guides you through the process of building a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment within Amazon Web Services (AWS). The objective is to help users gain hands-on experience with the core elements of VPC architecture by manually assembling each componentâ€”rather than relying on the automated VPC Wizard. Through a detailed walkthrough, you'll learn how to configure public and private subnets, set up routing and connectivity, and understand how each part contributes to a secure and functional cloud network. This approach offers deeper insight into the mechanics of VPCs and the relationships between their internal resources.
