3. Attach an Internet Gateway to the Route Table.

4. Associate Public Subnet to the Route Table:
   - In the Subnet Associations Tab, click on Edit Subnet Associations. ![Attach_SubnetAssociate](Images/Attach_SubnetAssociate.png)

5. Once all the configurations are completed, it should look like below:
   - Now the Instances launched within MyPublicSubnet will have access to the Internet.
   - There is another existing route table already available for MyVPC. It is the main route table created at the time the VPC was created. We will use it while creating the NAT Gateway. ![Attached_SubnetAssociate_Done](Images/Attached_SubnetAssociate_Done.png)
